# VR The Legend of Zelda

![alt text](LOZ.png?raw=true "VR The Legend of Zelda")

Second attempt at building a VR game.  Written for Oculus.  Excuse code quality, it is a mess.

The focus of this project was to learn:
  - Better "grabbing" and "carrying" of objects.
  - Implement haptics.
  - Implement a basic HUD.
  - Create a mount(ing) system and equipment.
  - Create a health system.
  - Creat a wallet system.
  - Work a bit with gestures.
  - Implement background audio.
  - Implement audio sources on objects.
  - Work with dynamic activation of "rooms" for performance.
  - Work with dynamic activation of enemies / tools / animations etc. for performance.
  - Create a shader that tiles more consistently
 

#### Todo:
  - Need left vs. right hand transforms for mounting (for example shield needs "mounted" differently based on the hand mount).
  - Implement "baggable" items and access them from menu room instead of mount points.


#### Probably won't do:

  - Dungens -- would be a lot of fun, but I've hit most of my learning objectives with this project.
